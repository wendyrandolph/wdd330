    <h2>FUNCTION PROPERTIES & METHODS</h2>
    <p>- all functions have a length property.  (ex square.length) </p>
   
    <h2>CALL & APPLY METHODS </h2>
        <p>ex. function sayHELLO(){ 
            return 'Hello, my name is ${this.name}'; 

        </p> 
    <h3>Custom Properties</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Memoisation - provides result caching. 
      </li>
      <li>IFFI -  Immediately invoked function expressions () is placed right after the function has been declared. </li>
      <li> Temporary Variables can be declared to reduce possible confusion if it's only needed "temporarily". </li>
      <li> Initialization Code - placing a code for a function that will only need to be ran once just inside a set of { } </li>
      <li> Safe Use of 'Strict Mode' - never any guarantee that if you are working on someone else's code that they coded in strict mode. </li>
            <p> (function() { <br>
                'use strict'; <br>
            // All your code would go inside this function<br>
            })(); </p>
            <li>Creating Self-contained Code Blocks - </li>
            <p>(function() { <br>
                // block A<br>
                const name = 'Block A';<br>
                console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);<br>
                }());<br>
                <br>
                (function() {<br>
                // block B<br>
                const name = 'Block B';<br>
                console.log(`Hello from ${name}`);<br>
            }());</p> 
        <li> Recursive Functions - one that recalls itself until a certain condition is met</li>
        <li> Callbacks - a function passed into another function that is invoked inside that function</li>
        <li> Functional Programming is a programming paradigm</li>
        <p> The ability to pass functions as arguments, return them from other functions, 
            and use anonymous functions and closures,<br> are all fundamental elements of functional programming that JavaScript excels at.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2> PURE FUNCTIONS </h2>
    <li> Has the following three rules - </li>
        <ul> 
            <li> "1) The return value of a pure function should only depend on the values provided as arguments. <br>
                It doesn't rely on values from somewhere else in the program."</li>
            <li> "2) There are no side-effects. A pure function doesn't change any values or data elsewhere in the program. It only makes non-destructive <br>
                data transformations and returns new values, rather than altering any of the underlying data."" </li>
            <li> "3) Referential transparency. Given the same arguments, a pure function will always return the same result."</li>
                    <p> In order to follow these rules, any pure function must have:<br>

                       <li> At least one argument; otherwise the return value must depend on something other than the arguments of the function, breaking the first rule</li>
                        <li>A return value; otherwise there’s no point in the function (unless it has changed something else in the program – in which case, it’s broken the 'no side-effects' rule).</li>
                        </p>
        </ul>
